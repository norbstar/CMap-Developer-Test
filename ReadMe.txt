NOTE - Issue pushing new branch to remote repository

git push -u origin dev-test-candidate-richard-norbron
remote: Permission to cmap-engineering/cmap-developer-test.git denied to norbstar.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/cmap-engineering/cmap-developer-test.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

Given the 403 error, I can only speculate that the repository may have been archived which would make it a read only resource and hense explain the error.

Given that only the master branch exists, it would seem that other candidates likely had the same experience and created their own GitHub repository.
